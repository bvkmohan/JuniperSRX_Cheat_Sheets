# 1. Sample Firewall Filter configuration

# 1.1
#
# Count the ICMP packets
#

set firewall filter COUNT_ICMP term 1 from protocol icmp
set firewall filter COUNT_ICMP term 1 then count icmp_packets
set firewall filter COUNT_ICMP term 1 then accept

set firewall filter COUNT_ICMP term 2 then accept

# 1.2
#
# Block a bad subnet
#

set firewall filter BAD_BOYS term 1 from source-address 192.168.10.0/24
set firewall filter BAD_BOYS term 1 then count bad_boys
set firewall filter BAD_BOYS term 1 then discard

set firewall filter BAD_BOYS term 2 then accept

# 1.3
#
# Block a bad port
#

set firewall filter BAD_PORT term 1 from destination-port 1434
set firewall filter BAD_PORT term 1 then discard

set firewall filter BAD_PORT term 2 then accept

# 1.4
#
# Apply the filters to the Interfaces
#

set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet filter input COUNT_ICMP
set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet filter input BAD_BOYS
set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet filter input BAD_PORT

# 1.5
#
# Blocking IP Options using Filters
#

set firewall filter BLOCK_IP_OPTIONS term 1 from ip-options route-record
set firewall filter BLOCK_IP_OPTIONS term 1 from ip-options router-alert
set firewall filter BLOCK_IP_OPTIONS term 1 from ip-options security
set firewall filter BLOCK_IP_OPTIONS term 1 from ip-option stream-id
set firewall filter BLOCK_IP_OPTIONS term 1 from ip-option strict-source-route

set firewall filter BLOCK_IP_OPTIONS term 1 then discard

set firewall filter BLOCK_IP_OPTIONS term 2 then accept

set interfaces ge-0/0/1.0 family inet filter input BLOCK_IP_OPTIONS

# 1.6
#
# Implementation case
# 
# Allow the below traffic to the Routing Engine on lo0 and block everything else
# 
# Management  Network:  10.1.10.1/24
