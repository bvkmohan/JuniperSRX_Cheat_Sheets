#
# Example Screens configuration
#

#START

#
# Screens have ICMP, IP, SESSION-LIMIT, TCP and UDP after IDS-OPTIONS
#

#
# Case 1.1
#
# Recon screening
#

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] icmp ip-sweep threshold 1000 #micro seconds

# Sweeps are measured based on the count of 10, above, a host outside the given zone can only generate 10 ICMP packets to
# 10 different destinations, means, 10 ICMP packets to 10 different destinations in 0.001 seconds ONLY.

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] icmp ip-sweep threshold 1000000

# 10 ICMP packets to 10 different hosts in 1 second # tight
# Same goes for the TCP and UDP sweeps

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] tcp tcp-sweep threshold 1000/1000000
set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] udp udp-sweep threshold 1000/1000000

#
# Case 1.2
#
# Port scan screening
#

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] tcp port-scan threshold 1000000 

# Meaning, a single source can send one SYN packet to 10 different ports in 1 second

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] tcp fin-no-ack

# Blocks the FIN packets that may get RST as reply for port scans

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] ip record-route-option
set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] ip timestamp-option
set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] ip security-option
set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] ip stream-option
set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] ip loose-source-route-option
set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] ip strict-source-route-option
set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] ip source-route-option

# IP Options are mostly not used for Ingress from untrust and are in many cases obsolete, but they can be used for reconn

#
# Case 1.3
#
# Basic IP screening
