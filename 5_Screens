# Example Screens configuration
#

#START

#
# Screens have ICMP, IP, SESSION-LIMIT, TCP and UDP after IDS-OPTIONS
#

#
# Case 1.1
#
# Recon screening
#

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] icmp ip-sweep threshold 1000 #micro seconds

# Sweeps are measured based on the count of 10, above, a host outside the given zone can only generate 10 ICMP packets to
# 10 different destinations, means, 10 ICMP packets to 10 different destinations in 0.001 seconds ONLY.

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] icmp ip-sweep threshold 1000000

# 10 ICMP packets to 10 different hosts in 1 second # tight
# Same goes for the TCP and UDP sweeps

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] tcp tcp-sweep threshold 1000/1000000
set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] udp udp-sweep threshold 1000/1000000

#
# Case 1.2
#
# Port scan screening
#

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] tcp port-scan threshold 1000000 

# Meaning, a single source can send one SYN packet to 10 different ports in 1 second

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] tcp fin-no-ack

# Blocks the FIN packets that may get RST as reply for port scans

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] ip source-route-option

# IP Options are mostly not used for Ingress from untrust and are in many cases obsolete, but they can be used for reconn

#
# Case 1.3
#
# Basic IP screening
#

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] ip bad-option

# Blocks malformed packets

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] ip unknown-protocol

# Blocks the packets with unknow protocol ID field

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] ip block-frag

# Blocks IP fragments, NOT RECOMMENDED

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] ip spoofing

# (RPF) Reverse Path Forwarding block

#
# Case 1.4
#
# Basic ICMP Screening
#

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] icmp fragment

# Blocks ICMP IP fragments

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] icmp large

# Blocks huge ICMP payloads

# Case 1.5
#
# Basic TCP Screening
#

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] tcp tcp-no-flag

# Blocks the TCP IP packets with no flags set

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] tcp syn-fin

# Blocks the TCP IP packets with SYN and FIN flags set

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] tcp syn-frag

# Blocks the TCP IP packet fragemts with SYN flag set

#
# Case 1.6
#
# Basic Denial-of-Service Screening
#

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] ip tear-drop

# Blocks the Teardrop attack, IP packet fragments overlapping with each other

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] ip land

# Blocks the Land attack, IP packet with Source IP/Port same as Destination IP/Port

#
# Case 1.7
#
# Advanced Denial-of-Service and Distributed Denail-of-Service Screening
#
# Service Floods and Bandwidth Floods
#

# 1.7.1
#
# ICMP

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] icmp flood threshold 10000

# Allows 10,000 ICMP packets/second only

# UDP

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] udp flood threshold 50000

# Allows 50,000 UDP packets/second. BETTER BE LONG!

# 1.7.3
#
# TCP - When we talk about TCP floods, basically it is about SYN Floods

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] tcp syn-flood timeout 10

# Timeout value for the embryonic sessions

set security screen ids-options [SCREEN-NAME] tcp syn-flood attack-threshold 1500

# IMPORTANT
#
# This will limit the sessions to per destination and port number PER SECOND, once this threshold is reached
# SRX with proxy the connections to the destination or the port.

set security screen ids-options [SCREEN-NAME] tcp syn-flood source-threshold 500

# Limits the SYN packets FROM a single source to any destination/port to 500

set security screen ids-options [SCREEN-NAME] tcp syn-flood destination-threshold 10000

# Limits the SYN packets TO a single destination from any source to 10,000 # WARNING

#
# 1.8
#
# Session table Screening
#

set security flow syn-flood-protection-mode syn-cookie

# Enables SYN cookies for the session table policing, uses MD5 for fingerprint

set security screen ids-option [SCREEN-NAME] tcp syn-ack-ack-proxy threshold 500

# -> ACK
# -> ACK
# -> ACK

# Limit sessions FROM a source to 500, INGRESS

set security flow aging early-ageout 20
set security flow aging high-watermark 90 low-watermark 70

# Aggresively drops the sessions after 20 seconds once the session table reaches 90% capacity, comes back to normal once

# Alarming the screens for testing before moving to production

set security screen ids-options [SCREEN-NAME] alarm-without-drop

# Sends an alarm to the event logs rather than taking the action specified

# Applying the screen

set security security zones security-zone [ZONE-NAME] screen [SCREEN-NAME]

# This will be applied to the entire zone, to all the interfaces that are mapped to it
